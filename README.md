# HumanEmotionRecognition-DeepLearning
To develop a realtime software that could predict human emotion using face detection.

First create a folder "data" where all the datasets are saved.

Next run the generate_data file to split the FER2013 dataset into train test and test into validation and final dataset.

Next run the main file.

Thank you
